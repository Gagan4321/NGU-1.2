        <h1>PUC</h1>
        
        <p>PUC stands for Pre-University Course. It is an intermediate course of two years duration that is offered in many states in India, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. PUC is equivalent to the 12th standard or the higher secondary examination, and it is a crucial step for students in India who want to pursue higher education. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The PUC curriculum includes a range of subjects such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, history, geography, and languages, among others. The successful completion of PUC enables students to apply for admission to undergraduate programs in universities and colleges.</p>
